Availability of system
Latency -)
Do we need analytics
Capacity estimation - read or write heavy - what is R:W ratio?
Do traffic estimation-  think about # of request you will get - hence derive QPS(query per second)
Do storage  estimation - learn conversions for this
Bandwidth estimation -  read and write requests * size of request per second
Caching strategy of hot request according to 20-80 rule
Memory estimations - cache memory
 What type of database should we use - SQL, NoSQL
user empathy, cost, understanding of the domain, testing, rollout and monitoring strategies.
